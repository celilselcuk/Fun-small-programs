# Christmas Time ðŸŽ„

## Overview
This is a festive Python program that uses Pygame to create an interactive Christmas scene. Users can design their own Christmas tree with a customizable number of segments while enjoying snowfall and decorations on the tree.

## Features
- Snowfall effect with randomly generated snowflakes.
- A customizable Christmas tree with up to 3 segments.
- Colorful tree decorations that change dynamically.
- A festive night-time background with a snowy ground.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed along with the `pygame` library.
   - Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`

2. **User Input**: When you run the program, you will be prompted to input the number of tree segments (`1`, `2`, or `3`). This determines the size of your Christmas tree.

3. **Launch the Scene**: After entering your input, sit back and enjoy the snowy Christmas scene with your custom tree design.

## How It Works
- The **tree** is drawn dynamically based on user input, with each segment adjusted for size and position.
- **Snowflakes** fall continuously from the top of the screen and accumulate near the bottom.
- The tree is decorated with colorful baubles that are placed at the tips of each segment.

## Customization
- Modify the colors of the tree decorations by editing the `deco_colours` list in the code.
- Adjust the snowfall speed and snowflake size in the `snow` and `update_snowflakes` functions.

## Quit the Program
To exit, simply close the Pygame window.

Enjoy a relaxing, festive experience with "Christmas Time"! ðŸŽ…âœ¨
